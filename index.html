    <h1>Happy Birthday Jasmine!</h1>

    <p><strong>Jasu!</strong> Today's your birthday! Now if that isn't the cherry on the cake, I don't know what is. Have a wonderful day!

Great friends are hard to find, so I feel really lucky to have found you. Happy birthday!
----------------
It's your birthday! I hope it's as bright as your smile, as warm as your heart, and as crazy as your mind!

You brighten the lives of everybody you touch. It's why I stay within reach. Have an amazing birthday!</p>
